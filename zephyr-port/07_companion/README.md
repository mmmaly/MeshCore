# MeshCore companion — Seeed XIAO nRF54L15 + LR2021 (Zephyr)

A MeshCore **companion-radio** node (the `examples/companion_radio` firmware, BLE-paired to the
MeshCore phone app) running on the Seeed Studio XIAO nRF54L15 with a Semtech LR2021 radio, built on
**mainline Zephyr** (not NCS). The MeshCore core, helpers, and the companion app are compiled
straight from this repo; the radio driver is stock RadioLib in generic (non-Arduino) mode.

## What's in here

| Path | Role |
|---|---|
| `src/main.cpp` | Zephyr entry point; runs the MeshCore companion loop |
| `src/target.cpp`, `src/target.h` | board/radio bring-up: pin map, band presets, TX-power clamp; radio = the shared `CustomLR2021`/`CustomLR2021Wrapper` |
| `src/serial_ble_interface.cpp/.h` | BLE transport: custom encryption-gated Nordic-UART (NUS) GATT service; central-driven pairing |
| `src/zephyr_internal_fs.cpp` | `InternalFileSystem` backed by a Zephyr flash partition (LittleFS) for prefs/identity |
| `compat/` | header-only shims (CayenneLPP, RTClib, Arduino glue) so the core builds without those libs |
| `dts/`, `app.overlay`, `prj.conf` | devicetree overlay (SPI/GPIO for the LR2021) and Kconfig |

All LR2021-specific radio fixes (standby before re-arming RX, header-CRC recovery, RX
max-length re-assert) live in `src/helpers/radiolib/CustomLR2021.h` /
`CustomLR2021Wrapper.h` at the repo root, shared with the bare-metal variant
(`variants/xiao_nrf54l15`). The core `RadioLibWrapper` exposes a neutral
`onBeforeStartRecv()` hook for the standby quirk, so other radios keep stock behaviour.

## Prerequisites

1. **Mainline Zephyr 4.4.99** (has the `xiao_nrf54l15` board) + its Python venv and the matching
   **Zephyr SDK**. A typical layout:
   - `ZEPHYR_BASE=$HOME/zephyrproject/zephyr`
   - west + deps in a venv, e.g. `$HOME/.zephyr-venv`
2. **Arduino libraries** under `$HOME/Arduino/libraries/` (the `CMakeLists.txt` references them by
   that absolute path). Only three are actually compiled/included:
   - `RadioLib/` — the LR2021 driver (generic HAL; the Arduino HAL is excluded by the build)
   - `Crypto/`
   - `base64/`

   (`CayenneLPP`, `RTClib`, `ArduinoJson` are *not* needed — they are shimmed in `compat/`.)
   `ed25519` ships in the repo (`lib/ed25519`).

## Build

From this directory (`zephyr-port/07_companion`):

```sh
source $HOME/.zephyr-venv/bin/activate
export ZEPHYR_BASE=$HOME/zephyrproject/zephyr

west build -b xiao_nrf54l15/nrf54l15/cpuapp -d build . --pristine
```

Default band is **sub-GHz (869.618 MHz / 62.5 kHz / SF8 / CR5)**. For the **2.4 GHz** preset
(2450 MHz / 500 kHz / SF8 / CR5, TX clamped to +12 dBm) add:

```sh
west build -b xiao_nrf54l15/nrf54l15/cpuapp -d build . --pristine -- -DMC_BAND_2G4=ON
```

### Side detectors and replies on the neighbour's SF

The LR2021 can demodulate up to three extra spreading factors in parallel on
the node's channel (all above the primary SF and within +4 of it). Build with

```
west build ... -- -DMC_SIDE_SFS=8,9,11      # default "8"; "" disables
```

and the node also hears SF8/SF9/SF11 nodes on its SF7 channel. A node heard
on a side detector is answered on *its* SF (`src/helpers/MultiSfMemory.h`,
shared with the Linux host node): every received frame is attributed to the
node that transmitted it (last hash of a flood path, else the sender; 2-byte
keys from adverts and 2-byte paths), and outgoing acks and addressed frames to
such a node go out on that SF for one frame, after which the primary SF,
preamble and side detectors are restored. Floods, adverts and control packets
stay on the primary, so the mesh is unaffected; an SF11 client next to an SF7
repeater built this way gets a bridge into the mesh but must use the same
frequency and bandwidth (the stock SF11 presets use another channel).
Console lines: `LR2021: rx on side SF8`, `LR2021: tx at SF8 (...)`.

With `MC_LOW_POWER` the duty-cycled receiver needs a sniff window long enough
for the slowest side SF to lock, which raises the on-time (side SF8 on SF7:
~45 % instead of ~25 %) and still catches only about 3 of 5 side-SF frames;
the always-on build catches them all. Set `MC_SIDE_SFS=""` on a battery node
that does not need it.

`MC_BAND_2G4` only sets the **first-boot** band; the running band/SF/BW/CR is also stored in prefs
and can be changed live from the app (`CMD_SET_RADIO_PARAMS`); and that choice now persists across
reboots. Two nodes must be on the same band to hear each other.

## Flash

The XIAO's on-board debugger enumerates as a **CMSIS-DAP** probe, so the simplest method is
**pyocd**. The pyocd target name is **`nrf54l`** (not `nrf54l15`), and `-e chip` does a clean erase:

```sh
pyocd flash -t nrf54l -e chip build/zephyr/zephyr.hex
pyocd reset -t nrf54l
```

With more than one board attached, add `-u <PROBE_UID>` (from `pyocd list`) so you flash the right
one — `-e chip` erases whatever you point it at.

`west flash` also works if you have J-Link or OpenOCD set up (the board defines both runners; there
is no pyocd runner):

```sh
west flash -d build --runner jlink      # or: --runner openocd
```

## Monitor (console / BLE PIN)

The nRF54L15 has **no USB**, so the console (boot log, the BLE PIN, and the `FS:` / `PREFS:` /
`radio_set_params` diagnostics) is read over the SWD probe via **RTT**. The default build sends the
console to a UART; to get RTT, build with a small overlay and read it with pyocd:

```sh
# rtt.conf
CONFIG_USE_SEGGER_RTT=y
CONFIG_RTT_CONSOLE=y
CONFIG_UART_CONSOLE=n

west build -b xiao_nrf54l15/nrf54l15/cpuapp -d build . -- -DEXTRA_CONF_FILE=rtt.conf
pyocd rtt -t nrf54l
```

## Pair

Advertises as **`MeshCore-<node name>`**; e.g. `MeshCore-544BA815` (the pubkey-derived default
name) or `MeshCore-NRF54L15-1` after you rename it; a rename from the app updates the advertised
name **live**, no reboot. In the MeshCore phone app, add a new companion device and pair; the node
uses a fixed passkey **`123456`** (printed on the RTT console at boot). Pairing is **central-driven**
(the app initiates encryption on first access to the NUS characteristics), which keeps iOS/Windows
from dropping the link right after the PIN.

## Notes / limitations

- **Prefs, identity, and contacts persist across power loss; BLE bonds do not**
  (`CONFIG_BT_SETTINGS` off). After a node reboot a previously-paired phone must **forget & re-pair**
  (it tries to resume a bond the node no longer holds → `0x13` disconnect loop). The correct settings
  backend for RRAM is **ZMS** (not NVS; RRAM has no erase); a 12 KB `settings_partition` is already
  reserved in `app.overlay` for when this is enabled. Future work (see `prj.conf`).
- **Filesystem persistence depends on `read_size == prog_size == block_size`** in
  `zephyr_internal_fs.cpp` (matches the proven bare-metal `helpers/nrf54` FS). With a smaller
  prog/read size, littlefs-v1's in-block commit-log path does **not** read back after a cold boot on
  RRAM; the FS remounts to its empty post-format state, so identity/prefs silently reset every boot.
  Erase is a no-op (RRAM is byte-alterable).
- **`CONFIG_BT_CTLR_ASSERT_OVERHEAD_START=n`** (which needs `CONFIG_BT_CTLR_ADVANCED_FEATURES=y` to be
  overridable; it lives in a `visible if` menu). The first BLE advertising event races the boot
  bring-up (radio SPI + FS mount) and runs tens of ms late; left at its default `y` the controller
  turns that into a **fatal** assert that takes the whole device (and the LoRa mesh) down. Disabled,
  the controller just skips the late event and continues. Likewise, a runtime band change
  (`radio_set_params`) is kept lightweight so it can't starve the live BLE connection into a fault.
- The NUS characteristics require **authenticated (MITM) pairing** (`BT_GATT_PERM_WRITE_AUTHEN`); a
  central that only does Just Works would be rejected. Relax to `_ENCRYPT` in
  `serial_ble_interface.cpp` if needed.
- RRAM writes run synchronously (`CONFIG_SOC_FLASH_NRF_RADIO_SYNC_NONE`) to avoid a ~24 s
  settings-write stall while BLE-connected.
- The board has no chip-controlled TCXO; the radio runs on the crystal (`tcxoVoltage = 0`).
